# The-New-Class-Project
The official repo of the updated The Class Project
So why should I download this mod instead of the original?
This mod is an updated version of the original, here's a detailed changelog:

- The original TCP had the Extended Spell Collection v2.0, here it has been updated to v4.0 that has updated spell descriptions and new spells
- More Priests subclasses updated to v4.0 from v2.01
- More Paladin subclasses updated to v4.0 from v3.0
- Removed extra Proficiencies feature which caused a bug on the abilities screen[imgur.com]
- Added Level Cap Raised to 33 mod (If you don't want this feature delete the "levelcapraise.gamedatabundle" from general folder.)
- This mod has new icons, if your game don't show them on the Paladin subclasses, find this mod in your steam workshop folder, copy the "2069852198" folder and paste on your game "override" folder, this should? fix the problem.

Semi Original Description:

The goal of this Project is to provide more character options, ability choices, and meaningful depth during character creation and progression. In order to accomplish this goal, numerous additions, changes, and tweaks to Classes, Subclasses, and abilities have been implemented.

Incorporated Mods
Because of the nature of modding class progress tables, many of the class and subclass mods on the Nexus are not compatible with each other. With their permissions, the following mods have been incorporated into The Class Project.

Prestige "Classes" and Feats
Prestige Classes and Feats are unique abilities for characters that become available when certain conditions are met. The first of (hopefully) many Prestige Classes is:

Class Rebuilds
I have included my new rebuilds of the Barbarian and Fighter progression tables, pictures of which are included in the images above. Both classes need more ability options and this is the impetus behind these initial changes.

For the Fighter, I have broken the vanilla fighting stances into separately trained stances with upgrade chains. From a design perspective, I am trying to make the Fighter into a self-buffing adventurer with single-target weapon based attack abilities. The Fighter should be the best at hold his or her own against a single tough enemy.

For the Barbarian, I have broken the frenzy mini-tree into separately trained frenzies with upgrade chains. From a design perspective, I'm trying to make the Barbarian into the most efficient melee AOE class type with tankability during frenzies.


Passives Rebuilt
- Recently updated
A select number of generic passives are now locked behind a character's Background selection. A Background now provides the character with 2 automatically granted passives at power level 5. I have also expanded the number of generic passives from to roughly 80 (up from ~50) and plan to create more. The number of available Backgrounds has also been expanded and each Culture may now choose from one of 17 Backgrounds (the maximum allowed by the UI).

Because Class selection occurs before Culture and Background selection, I have implemented a "cyclopedia" at the beginning of the character creation process that will allow you to preview the abilities associated with your character choices.

Compared to the previous versions of this mod, the passives are far less background intensive.


Weapon Proficiencies Rebuilt
The system of weapon proficiencies has been rebuilt and expanded, and includes the following features:
Unproficient weapons now suffer an accuracy penalty.
Each weapon type now has three available modal abilities (the vanilla modal has been "deleted")
These modal abilities require training and become available after selecting a weapon proficiency.
Modal abilities occupy 1 of 3 groups: Primary, Secondary, Ranged
Only a single proficiency within a single group may be active at a time
You now have the option to select "No Proficiency" during character progression

Highlight: "Pistol Whip" for Pistol and Arquebus.

Notes: Only newly created characters will suffer the Unproficient accuracy penalty. For existing characters, the new modal abilities will become visible during the next level up.

WIP: I am working on new icons and descriptions for each modal ability that will help relay info in the UI.

This feature has been removed due to a bug making the passive abilities in the abilities screen way offscreen.

Support and Development Plan
Hopefully everything is in order.

Compatibility
The Class Project modifies ALL of the vanilla class progression table entries (the game will only load and recognize a single progression table) and numerous vanilla abilities.
This mod will, therefore, conflict with any mod that changes select abilities and/or progression tables. Progression table conflicts will have more negative impact, so The Class Project should be loaded after other such mods (if those mods must be installed).
